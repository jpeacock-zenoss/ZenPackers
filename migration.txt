Any Migration should do the following things:

1. Identify the old zenpack objects, bound to a device.
   Find all device classess and devices where "Oracle" template is bound.
   * Look for : zDeviceTemplates that are overridden

2. Extract the old information from those templates

- Leave them bound... for continuity
- Enable our modeler plugin for device class or device (zCollectorPlugins gets invoked, gets added to list).
- Populate zOracleConnectionStrings

- Create new Instance components from the old templates and populuate the new

4. Leave the old ZP objects alone: Provide documentation on how to un-bind the old templates.
   * Oracle Template needs to be bound to device

zSetXenProperty is safest way to set a zproperty... 
getTitleOrId: Best way to get name of device.
getOrganizerName is best way to get Device Class name.
