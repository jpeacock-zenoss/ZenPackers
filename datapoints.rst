DataPoints in Detail
=========================

ID
-------
The ID is the identifying label for the point.

Aliases
--------

Aliases are primarily for Analytics reports. They allow you to have similar
points be reported in the same way, given the same alias. Aliases also allow
you to have a common RPN formula to convert the data to a known unit or type.
